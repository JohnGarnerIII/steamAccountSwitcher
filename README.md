# Steam Account Switcher

This program allows you to easily switch between different Steam accounts.
## Requirements

    Windows operating system
    Steam installed on your machine

## Usage

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Run the steamSwitcher.py file.
    A GUI will appear with two radio buttons labeled "Main" and "Second".
    Select one of the radio buttons to select the desired Steam account.
    Click the "Select" button to set the selected account as the active one in Steam, and start the Steam application.

## Note

    You need to replace the hardcoded username1 and username2 with your actual usernames in the script.
    Ensure that Steam is installed on your machine before running the script.
    If Steam is already running, the script will kill the running instance before starting a new one.
